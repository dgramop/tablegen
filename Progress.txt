Our overall goal is to create a Java program that uses GUI to design a work table. The program gathers specifications from customers, computes the price and coordinates of appliances and add-ons, and renders a basic diagram of the table. 


So far, the following has been accomplished:
* The group has been familiarized on git. We are not using git-flow or any kind of git methodology like that because we had some new-to-git members. We’ve agreed on some basic git hygiene like leaving at least somewhat descriptive commit messages and no-force-push without group consensus.
* Learned how to draw basic graphics
* Coded the portal where customers can enter and submit their desired table dimensions
* Wrote the code that checks the values the customer enters and makes sure they are valid numbers before storing them to variables
* Coded the basic methods in the classes for all table components
   * Leg
   * Slat
   * Lamp
   * Receptacle
   * Switch
   * Table
* Started collecting prices for the different components of the table for different stores
* Computing the position of the table’s legs based on the dimensions of the table and the overhang requested by the customer


To Do:
* Write more code for the user input portal - ask how many add-on appliances
* Display the correct graphics with the correct locations/dimensions
* Finish gathering and inputting prices for each component and store
* Write code that calculates the placement of objects and validates they are not on top of eachother
* Additional validation (i.e. lamps and receptacles must be kept a certain distance from each other to prevent overlapping, tables must be large enough to contain lamps and receptacles, overhand must not create a condition in which there is not enough space for the legs)
